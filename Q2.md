## Assignment


## Prep

## Things to think about

- This time the loop was changed to a for loop that will run the code 6 times. Why was that needed? 
- Why was the trafficLight added to the `main` function and not left at the top of the file?
- What do you think is the advantage of having the `getCurrentTrafficLightState` and `getNextStateIndex` functions?


## Things to think about

- The `valueCounts` is implemented as an array. Do you think there is another way to store this? Why do you think the decision was made to go with an array? 
- What do you think about the code division? Would you add another function or maybe remove one? Why?

During testing of my assignment I received a warning 'using for..in loop isn't recommended'. Why its better to use another methods like Object.key() or Object.value() instead of for in?
- easy to confuse with of
- let's compare it
- how can we make it less confusing?
- "x is not recommended" -> what to do?
- Check the docs

When working with extensive or complex code, at what points should I set breakpoints to effectively use the debugger?
How can I determine which concepts to go deeper into, to avoid wasting time and ensure efficient use of my efforts? (as we know the material is enorm)
- solve the problem at hand
- what did you find annoying?
- what gave you problems?

I didn’t fully get it why do we need private scope, if I can replace these private methods:

```javascript
const Module = (function () {
 return {
  myMethod: function () {
   console.log(1);
  },
  someOtherMethod: function () {
   console.log(2);
  },
 };
})();

Module.myMethod();
Module.someOtherMethod();
// To these public methods:
const Module = {
 myMethod: function () {
  console.log(1);
 },
 someOtherMethod: function () {
  console.log(2);
 },
};

Module.myMethod();
Module.someOtherMethod();
```
- how do we add a private method?
- how about private state?
- import a library, what can you change and not?
- easy fix; only allow changing what can. 
- global scope pollution
- anything in the second object is public, but there is no state now.

What factors should I consider when nesting a function within another function? For example, should I begin by declaring functions globally, and if I am sure that the outcome is not needed elsewhere, should I then nest where it is needed ?
- What is nesting?
- why nest? why not?
- how does nesting affect closure?

Is it better to always write code using modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond), or is it acceptable to write code using older JavaScript (pre-ES6)?
For example:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```
- compare syntax
- function vs arrow differences

```javascript
// TODO make it possible to add as many numbers together as desired
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
sum(1, 2); // 3
```

Hi. My first question is same as Sofia’s question. I have that warning too. And I would like to ask about three dots (…) syntax. How do I know that is used for spread or rest operator especially in function. Is it useful to make nested functions with using arrow function. Which one makes easy to read code in real world experience.? ( for me now it’s easy to read writing with function if I have nested function.).
- infinite arguments vs copying,
- where you are using it

If an array or an object is assigned to a new variable it will be passed by reference, therefore, still mutable.
```javascript
const arr = [1, 2];
const newArr = arr;
newArr.push(3);
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3]
```
Is there any case where such an assignment is needed, or should we always avoid it?
```javascript
// Define a shared shopping cart
const shoppingCart = {
    items: []
};

// Function to add an item to the cart, cart passed by reference
function addItem(cart, item) {
    cart.items.push(item);
    console.log(`Added ${item} to the cart.`);
}

// Function to remove an item from the cart, cart passed by reference
function removeItem(cart, item) {
    const index = cart.items.indexOf(item);
    if (index > -1) {
        cart.items.splice(index, 1);
        console.log(`Removed ${item} from the cart.`);
    } else {
        console.log(`${item} not found in the cart.`);
    }
}

// Function to display the cart contents
function displayCart(cart) {
    console.log(`Shopping Cart Contents: ${cart.items.join(', ')}`);
}

// Example usage
addItem(shoppingCart, 'Apples');
addItem(shoppingCart, 'Bread');
displayCart(shoppingCart); // Shopping Cart Contents: Apples, Bread
removeItem(shoppingCart, 'Apples');
displayCart(shoppingCart); // Shopping Cart Contents: Bread

// This modification explicitly demonstrates passing the shopping cart by reference to functions.
// Changes made within these functions directly affect the original shoppingCart object.
```
- What is the downside of copying something?
- Lots of functions using the same state
- Subscribing to changes
- *side effects* 

```javascript
let myObj = { a: 1 };
const myFunc = obj => {
  obj.a++;
  return obj;
}
let otherObj = myFunc(myObj);

myObj;                  // { a: 2 }
otherObj;               // { a: 2 }
myObj === otherObj;     // true

myObj = { a: 4, b: 0 };

myObj;                  // { a: 4, b: 0 }
otherObj;               // { a: 2 }
myObj === otherObj;     // false
```

Are there specific patterns or refactoring techniques that can help ensure the correct scope is maintained when converting from var to let and const?
- What does refactoring mean?
- Why refactor?
- What could go wrong?
- 4 devs, 5 days a week, 3 months -  how many files of JS would you have?

When I am writing a code, normally I use console.log. When is it necessary to run a test? how to use these tools effectively?
- test vs debug
- console.log vs debugger
- "when is it necessary", you don't know
