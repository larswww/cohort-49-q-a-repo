I recently found a couple of problems/tasks in Leetcode with the instruction: "Solve this problem without using map, forEach, filter etc."
I understand that this condition is only for creating own problem solving logic. But are there certain situations where for  or for of loops are better than map, forEach and so on?

Variable Environment: Similar to Lexical Environment but focuses on variable bindings created by var declarations. currently the var is not used. so the Variable Environment is not used either?

My question is also about closure. How do closures help to create private variables? 
```javascript
function createCounter() {
    // Private variable
    let count = 0;

    // Closure that has access to the private variable
    return {
        increment: function() {
            count++;
            return count;
        },
        decrement: function() {
            count--;
            return count;
        },
        getCount: function() {
            return count;
        }
    };
}

// Create a counter instance
const counter = createCounter();
counter.count = 0 // wont work!
const secondCounter = createCounter();

console.log(counter.increment()); // 1
console.log(counter.increment()); // 2
console.log(counter.decrement()); // 1
console.log(counter.getCount());  // 1

// Trying to access the private variable directly will result in an error
// console.log(counter.count); // undefined
```

And I didn’t well understand about finding variables in the scope marked closure. ? Can you please give an example and explain it?

Closures can keep a link to a variable and not delete it with garbage collector, and it can use a memory, do we need to think about it when working with closures?
- depends on what you are working on
```javascript
// Function that creates a large object and returns a closure
function createClosure() {
    // Simulating a large object
    let largeObject = new Array(1000000).fill('Some large data');
    
    // Closure that references the large object
    return function() {
        console.log(largeObject[0]);
    };
}

// Global variable holding the closure
let leakyClosure = createClosure();

// The largeObject is not garbage collected because leakyClosure holds a reference to it
```

My question is confusing in and of itself because, at first, I thought I understood it. However, after watching more videos, I don't understand it anymore. Do closures exist in the global execution context as variables after the parent function is destroyed? Where do they really exist if they are not assigned globally? Can a closure remain a function that is defined but not called?

I have read about closure and often encountered the "WARNING" that closure can cause memory leaks. Could you explain in a pragmatic way how I can prevent this?

Hi , are Lexical scope and functional scope the same ? or related ? (edited) 
```javascript
function outerFunction() { //lexical
    const outerVariable = 'I am from outer scope';

    function innerFunction() { //compile-time, doesn't change!
        console.log(outerVariable); // Can access outerVariable due to lexical scope
    }

    innerFunction();
}

outerFunction(); // Output: I am from outer scope
```
```javascript
function anotherFunction() { // function
    const functionVariable = 'I am from function scope';

    if (true) { // run-time, if false the scope changes!
        const blockVariable = 'I am from block scope';
        console.log(functionVariable); // Can access functionVariable due to functional scope
        console.log(blockVariable); // Can access blockVariable within the same block
    }

    // console.log(blockVariable); // Uncaught ReferenceError: blockVariable is not defined
}

anotherFunction();
```

All closures-related examples I have seen are to demonstrate how they work. Could you give us a practical example where a closure is used- a demonstration of a use case?
- in-memory state, between function calls

```javascript
function memoize(fn) {
    const cache = {}; // Private variable

    return function(...args) {
        const key = JSON.stringify(args);
        if (cache[key]) {
            return cache[key];
        }
        const result = fn(...args);
        cache[key] = result;
        return result;
    };
}

const factorial = memoize(function(n) {
    if (n === 0) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
});

console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120 (cached result)
```
