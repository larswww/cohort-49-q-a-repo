##### Things to think about
    Which way of representing the traffic light did you find better? Why?
    What happens if you change the loop to a do-while loop instead of a while loop? Why?
    We could have also used a for loop to make the traffic light do 2 full rotations. Do you think that would be better? Why or why not?


# Questions

## Fatemeh Alinejad
In a large JavaScript codebase, what techniques or tools can be implemented to effectively identify examples of code repetition? Beyond simply searching for duplicated code, what other strategies and best practices can be used to refactor the code in order to stick to the DRY principle?
- am I doing this again?
- export/import
- Do One Thing

## Āsim
I usually define the sub-functions at the bottom of my code and call them at the top to improve the overall readability. However, since the arrow function expression is not hoisted, I have to stick to the function declaration which in itself, in some cases, is a bit harder to read and write.
Should I stick to top-down coding with only function declarations? make it down-top with more freedom in choosing function syntax? or is there another way to balance all of that?

Js is like our spoken languages  in term of having various expressions and terms that refer to the same meaning .. as a programmer should we apply all the codes that give the same output but in different way .. simply  why should we use for looping" for" .. "while" .. "do while" if "for" alone give the easiest simplest way to get the loop result ... and the same with variables like "let" can do the work of "const "and "var" and the same in" if" and " switch"
- same same, but different?

Hello, my question is about functions. A function can be declared in the normal way, stored in a variable, or defined as an arrow function. They all essentially do the same thing. Is there an instance where one way must be used and not the other?

Hi :slightly_smiling_face:
 I have a couple of questions:
Can you tell us about the value of NaN? How and where can we use it? And especially about its interesting behavior: NaN === NaN gives false. (the stackoverflow explanation just broke my brain)
About the prep-exercise: switch or if...else? What is better for the solution? (I used spaghetti "if...else", but now I think switch is a more logical choice).
And the last question is not related to this module, but I need an opinion (or personal experience). When is the perfect time to start learning TypeScript? During this module, after JS module or after all program?
- what's 0/0?
- uniquely nothing
- something you can't represent

## Dorelys Rodríguez
My question is a general question. As a beginner, what are the common mistakes that beginners tend to make? What are the scenarios where I should think twice before I code?
- DRY
- Not readable, bad variable names, coding for themselves only
- Not testing
- Not K.I.S.S


## Tugbanur
Hi. What are the best practices for deciding when to use if...else  or switch...case in a project?
And place of if … else to use ( ……?….. : ……… ) makes any difference ? Is it like a shortform of if ….else or something else ?
Can you share some real-world examples from your experience where choosing if...else or switch...case made a significant impact on the project?
- no significant impact
- Controllers
- Very significant impact (if you care)

We have a prep-exercise every week. Should we create a separate repository for each prep-exercise or a single repository for all prep-exercises on GitHub? Which option is better?

Does performance (execution time and memory usage) really matter when coding? If so, should we prioritize it over other coding principles or does it depend on the special use case?
For example, if I want to console log the elements of an array I can think of three proper ways:
.forEach()
for ( .. of .. )
for
while the readability and maintainability are best on the first one, it is the opposite in terms of computational resources. (edited)

Hi, as professional developers, we aim for our code to run as fast as possible and use minimal computer memory. We can achieve this by choosing the right algorithm? Is it possible that our code, which may not use the best algorithm and is not fully optimized, could still be added to a real project?
- yes
